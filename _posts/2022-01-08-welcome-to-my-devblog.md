Welcome to **CHKhub**! This is a Tech Blog where I post what I learned while studying and how to solve problems.
{: .message }


In fact, I'm just a **High School Student Developer**, who have started interest in Python on 2021. However, my passion for development has ignited, so I have reached a level where I can proceed with personal project within a year.


**However**, as I continued to code, I felt the need to organize what I had learned and further solve complex structures.

## ToDoList

So, this page is where I write what you continue to write on this blog or create new features for.

### List

- <strong>Database Structure and SQL<strong>
- <strong>Discord.py</strong>
